Speed up checkout and increase sales
Speed up checkout
With 70% of all online shopping carts abandoned before an order is placed3, retailers are striving to simplify and speed up each purchase. Autocomplete reduces address entry to just a few keystrokes or taps, cutting checkout time and helping to improve conversions.2

Get an extra layer of address protection
Make the checkout process easier on customers by using Address Validation to identify address components, fix errors, and validate existing addresses. Validating addresses early in the process can help reduce costs associated with failed deliveries, canceled orders, and chargebacks.

Reduce failed deliveries
As many as 5% of all addresses are entered incorrectly4, leading to costly delivery mistakes, frustrated customers, and unreliable CRM data. Autocomplete increases convenience and reliability by replacing manual entry of addresses with a menu of complete options. Address Validation can help improve delivery success by offering address corrections and suggestions that will ensure deliveries arrive on time and to the correct location.

Maximize fleet performance for scheduled deliveries
Create exceptional delivery experiences
Make address entry faster and easier for your customers, and more accurate for you and your drivers with Address Validation. It makes sure what was entered is an existing address, based on a variety of data sources, including postal services. And keep your customers happy and informed with Shipment Tracking, which lets them see the real-time location and ETA of their packages.

Help drivers make deliveries safely and on time
Drivers are at the heart of your operations, and their delivery jobs are getting harder. Providing them with helpful experiences has never been more important. Give your drivers an overview of their day so they can easily adjust their route plan and get to their destinations on time. Drivers can efficiently complete tasks right from your app with Driver Routing & Navigation, which includes turn-by-turn directions, lane level guidance, and speed limits. And, by providing more precise delivery locations, we can help your drivers get to the right place, at the right time.

Optimize fleet performance and planning
Last mile delivery makes up a large portion of total shipping costs, and pressure to efficiently manage your fleet is rising. Current and historic insights help you plan optimal routes that reflect your fleet’s needs, and adapt in real time based on traffic and other conditions. With visibility across the fleet, you can better understand driver locations, ETAs, and potential issues as they arise. This can result in fewer delays, informed drivers, and happy customers.
